## [Overview](./readme.md)

### Game Concept

There is an unseen world and humans have invented a technology to see the world where you can draw a map to Unseenia, take a picture of the map, and the technology allows you to see Unseenia and play games. You create game models by putting a toy or Lego creation on a piece of graph paper, take a picture of it from multiple angles, and the software creates a Voxel model of the object. You create worlds by printing out graph paper, drawing maps on the graph paper, placing toys on the map, taking pictures, moving the toys to other positions, taking pictures, and the computer creates a game animation script. The app listens to audio people talking, and creates an AI generated script based on what the users are talking about.
