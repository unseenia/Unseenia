### Game Flow Summary

The game starts out in the real world where the player is. You start out with either a physical or virtual piece of paper. If the player doesn't have a piece of paper, they use a drawing app and stylus if they have one. The game flow is modeled after the player having a physical piece of paper. The player draws a map to Unseenia and says what they want to play and see and something in the real-world that it looks like. The unseenia engine then starts showing the playing 3D models, the user starts picking out characters that kind of look like what they want. The user can put together Lego objects, take pictures of them on the graph paper, and they show up in the game as 3D models. Either the player or the computer specifies colors for the characters, and the player draws where the characters are at on the map. The player starts describing the way the characters move and can give them items. Players start to build servers and mini-games called Worlds. You log onto various Worlds by drawing a map to that World instead of typing in a server address, similar to crafting in MineCraft.

Once a player has created a World, the files can be saved in to a file in a folder along with the scripts for the server or mini-game to share with others. The world editor is built into the game engine with server for communicating with Visual Studio or VS Code.
